## 6. Differentiation

Grounded in what this build actually does (see `06-architecture.md`):

- **Distinctive capability in code:** A chat/agent demo built on assistant-ui + Supabase (liberty-assist) and Gemini-multi-tool experiments; educational/portfolio value in a market with well-funded incumbents.
- **Capability a competitor would need to replicate:** proxy of the build's core path.
- **Why defensible:** depth of vertical fit and delivery ownership, not a generic dashboard.

## 7. Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Category commoditized / incumbent floor falling | Medium–High | Medium | Position on differentiation above, not price |
| Unverified market figures | High | High | Keep `[TO BE VALIDATED]` markers until sourced |
| Claims ahead of code (demo vs. shipped) | Medium | High | Keep README/copy aligned with the source tree |
